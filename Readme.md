## Simpe Atom Feed Demo

This little demo project is a simple Atom feed displayer using Typescript + React + Redux and Meteor.

Since this project is client-only (using JQL proxy for http requests) it can be deployed at any static hosting service.
It depends on the [meteor-build-client](https://github.com/frozeman/meteor-build-client) tool to build it that way.
